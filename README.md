### [`font-weight`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/#font-weight-prop)
> Quite often there are only a few weights available for a particular font family. When a weight is specified for which no face exists, a face with a nearby weight is used. In general, bold weights map to faces with heavier weights and light weights map to faces with lighter weights

<b>Stay bold</b> =)
